%% REFLECTIONS %%

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easy to compare and pin-point

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could easily create new files, compare files

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can choose your points in version history to align with changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So you can link them to certain changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log allows you to see all your commits
    git diff then allows you to compare one commit to another

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
