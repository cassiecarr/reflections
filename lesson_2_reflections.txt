%%Learned git init (create repository) and git status (status of repository)
cassandracarr reflections $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/cassandracarr/Documents/version-control/reflections/.git/

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	lession_1_reflections.txt
	lesson_2_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

%%Learned git add (adds the file to the staging area)
%%Learned git commit (commits what is in the staging area)
%%Note: if a new file hasn't been added to the staging area, the last commited file is in the staging area
	If you want to compare what's in the staging area to what you have changed
	in the working directory, you can use git diff without providing the two
	git id's
	To compare what's in the staging area to what is in the latest repository
	you use git diff --staged
%%You can use git diff --hard to reset all files in working directory and staging area
that haven't been committed yet

%%REFLECTIONS%%

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You need to set up the repository so you can start adding commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to only add certain files to a commit that may or may
	not be the sum of files in the working directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	You can add one file at a time to the staging area, as seperate commits
	if the changes are unrelated.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
